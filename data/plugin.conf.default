# plugin config file
#
# NOTE: the only mandatory setting when adding a <Plugin></Plugin> configuration is Name
#       if no configuration for a given plugin can be found or a setting is not present it will fall back to a default value
#       these default values might not be useful though
#
# Disable: if added to a plugin's settings the according plugin will be enabled/disabled (options: yes, no)
#
# Include: include a given file to parse in this configuration (absolute path or relative to .motoko/profiles/'profile')
#          this setting can be added at any level (globally, specific to a plugin or even within a nested setting of a plugin configuration)
#          it can be used to place common settings of different profiles into a single file (e.g., items to pick or a common chicken configuration)
#
# NOTE: keep in mind that when adding an Include within a plugin configuration's nested setting, the setting's name
#       will be replaced with the included file's name and hence will not be availale to the plugin's configuration
#       parsing code (which is necessary in most cases)
